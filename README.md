# cairo-docker-devenv
Docker dev environment for Cairo with starknet-devnet and starknet.py. The starknet-devnet version is set to 0.5.0a0 because the version on the main branch was conflicting with the installed Cairo version. The version should not be hardcoded once the newest versions are no longer conflicting with Cairo.
